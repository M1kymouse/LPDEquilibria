# LPDEquilibria
Set of Python classes for the computation of magnetic equilibria and field-aligned meshes for edge plasma codes such as SOLPS-ITER in Linear Plasma Devices. The equilbrium magnetic field is computed using the Green function for the Grad-Shafranov equation, using the specification of the field coils location in the (R,Z) plane, as well as the overal current flowing in them.
